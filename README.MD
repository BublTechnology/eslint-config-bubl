# Bubl Eslint Configuration
This code style guide is meant to be compliant with [StanardJS](http://standardjs.com/index.html) but to be more detailed.

To use you will need to install both this package as well as eslint
```
  npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-config-bubl
```

You will then need to add an eslintrc that extends this like so
```json
  {
    "extends": "bubl"
  }
```
